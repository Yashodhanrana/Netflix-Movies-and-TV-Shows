# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows

Firstly I just upload the file and then see what the dataset exactly tells us about after carefully seeing the data set I clean that data reduce the null value, clean the data.

After that filter the database with some criteria (filtering for movies and TV shows)
See Top Netflix shows
Top ten Countries watching Netflix
Top ten Directors
Top ten actors
Checking the rating of different movies and shows
The highest count **TV-MA** is the rating that shows a program is intended for adults. **MA** stand for **"Mature Audience"**. Children aged 17 and younger should not view these programs. \
The second largest is the **'TV-14'**. A **TV-14** program is meant for children over 14 years of age.
